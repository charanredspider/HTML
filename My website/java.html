    <p style="font-size: 20px;">In computer science, a programming language is said to have 
        first-class functions if it treats functions as 
        first-class citizens. This means the language supports 
        passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values 
        from other functions,
         and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures.[1] Some 
         programming language theorists require support for anonymous functions 
         (function literals) as well.[2] In languages with first-class functions,
          the names of functions do not have any special status; they are treated 
          like ordinary variables with a function type.[3] The term was coined by 
          Christopher Strachey in the context of "functions as first-class citizens" in
           the mid-1960s.[4]

        First-class functions are a necessity for the functional programming style, in 
        which the use of higher-order functions is a standard practice. A simple example 
        of a higher-ordered function is the map function, which takes, as its arguments, 
        a function and a list, and returns the list formed by applying the function to 
        each member of the list. For a language to support map, it must support passing a
         function as an argument.
        
        There are certain implementation difficulties in passing functions as arguments
         or returning them as results, especially in the presence of non-local variables
          introduced in nested and anonymous functions. Historically, these were termed 
          the funarg problems, the name coming from "function argument".[5] In early 
          imperative languages these problems were avoided by either not supporting 
          functions as result types (e.g. ALGOL 60, Pascal) or omitting nested functions
           and thus non-local variables (e.g. C). The early functional language Lisp took
            the approach of dynamic scoping, where non-local variables refer to the closest 
            
            definition of that variable at the point where the function is executed, instead 
            of where it was defined. Proper support for lexically scoped first-class functions
             was introduced in Scheme and requires handling references to functions as
         closures instead of bare function pointers,[4] which in turn makes garbage coll
         ection a necessity.
